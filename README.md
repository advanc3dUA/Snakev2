# Snakev2

In this game I try to use MVC model to separate model, view & controller.

Features:
- only UIKit is used
- counts score, saves the record with player name to userdefaults (current record can be checked at menu page bottom)
- record can be reset with reset button in options page
- level (speed) grows every 10 points. Can be turned off with related switch in options
- classic mode (snake w/o images, black squares instead of it's pieces)

Enjoy!
